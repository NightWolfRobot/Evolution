# Evolution
[Univsersity Project] Simulation of wild life

Wolfs eat sheeps and if their angry (defined by a constant in the constant file of the game) turn to 0, it dies and
leave some minerals.

Minerals are here juste for one turn, because just after, the grass grows.

For the sheeps, it's quite the same as wolfs except they have to eat grass.

For each the can reproduce themselves if their are close to another same animal but different sex.

The program is coded to be flexible, each behavior (eat, reproduction, move) are in a Patern Strattegy and we can
do some funy things like turn a sheep into a canibal sheep just changing one line of the code.

The program is coded in MVC.
